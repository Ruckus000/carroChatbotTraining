## Data Quality and Preparation

### Training Data Balance

**Best Practice**: Maintain balanced representation across intents.

**Implementation**:

- Aim for at least 20-30 examples per intent
- For complex intents, increase to 50+ examples
- Keep the ratio between the largest and smallest intent below 10:1
- Use dashboard's support metrics to identify underrepresented intents

**Example**:

```
Intent         | Examples | Action
---------------|----------|-------------------------
book_flight    | 120      | Sufficient
check_weather  | 85       | Sufficient
transfer_money | 15       | Add more examples (aim for 30+)
```

### Data Diversity

**Best Practice**: Include diverse language patterns for each intent.

**Implementation**:

- Include different phrasings and vocabulary
- Vary sentence structures (questions, commands, statements)
- Include both formal and informal language
- Add examples with spelling variations and common errors
- Include domain-specific terminology

**Dashboard Analysis**:

- Use the Error Explorer to identify missing patterns
- Look for clusters of similar misclassified examples
- Add new examples that follow these patterns

### Data Cleanliness

**Best Practice**: Maintain consistent, well-formatted training data.

**Implementation**:

- Remove duplicate examples
- Fix inconsistent entity annotations
- Ensure consistent intent boundaries (no overlapping definitions)
- Check for and fix mislabeled examples

**Validation Approach**:

- Export a random sample of examples for human review
- Identify examples with high loss during training for review
- Use cross-validation to identify suspiciously misclassified examples

### Out-of-Scope Handling

**Best Practice**: Train the model to recognize out-of-scope queries.

**Implementation**:

- Create a dedicated "out_of_scope" or "fallback" intent
- Add 50+ diverse examples of queries outside your domain
- Include common but irrelevant questions users might ask
- Review production logs for actual out-of-scope queries

**Dashboard Indicators**:

- High false positives for a particular intent can indicate out-of-scope queries being incorrectly classified
- Low confidence predictions may indicate out-of-scope inputs

## Intent Classification Optimization

### Refining Similar Intents

**Best Practice**: Clarify boundaries between similar intents.

**Implementation**:

- Use the confusion matrix to identify frequently confused intents
- Consider these options:
  1. **Improve distinction**: Add examples that clarify the difference
  2. **Merge intents**: Combine very similar intents and use entities to distinguish subtypes
  3. **Split intents**: Divide overly broad intents into more specific ones

**Example Refinement**:
For confusion between "cancel_order" and "return_item":

- Add examples to "cancel_order" about stopping before shipping
- Add examples to "return_item" about sending back after receiving
- Consider using entities like "order_stage" to distinguish them

### Handling Multi-Intent Utterances

**Best Practice**: Develop a strategy for utterances containing multiple intents.

**Implementation**:

- Choose one of these approaches:
  1. **Primary intent focus**: Label with the most important intent
  2. **Intent splitting**: Split into multiple training examples
  3. **Multi-intent model**: Use a model architecture that supports multiple intent detection

**Dashboard Insights**:

- Multi-intent utterances often appear as consistent errors in the Error Explorer
- They typically have low confidence scores even when classified correctly

### Intent Hierarchies

**Best Practice**: Structure related intents in hierarchical relationships.

**Implementation**:

- Create parent-child intent relationships
- Use two-stage classification:
  1. Classify by parent intent category
  2. Sub-classify within the category
- Alternatively, use naming conventions like "payment_new", "payment_status"

**Benefits**:

- Improves accuracy for closely related intent families
- Makes confusion patterns more interpretable
- Allows for shared response logic for related intents

## Entity Recognition Improvement

### Entity Annotation Consistency

**Best Practice**: Develop and follow clear entity annotation guidelines.

**Implementation**:

- Create specific rules for entity boundaries
- Document rules for overlapping entities
- Standardize handling of prepositions and articles
- Define specific patterns for structured entities (dates, numbers, etc.)

**Common Issues to Address**:

- Inconsistent inclusion of articles (e.g., "the hotel" vs. "hotel")
- Inconsistent handling of possessives (e.g., "John's account" vs. "John")
- Punctuation handling (e.g., including trailing periods or commas)

### Entity Type Design

**Best Practice**: Design entity types based on functional needs and data patterns.

**Implementation**:

- Create entities based on how they'll be used in responses
- Balance specificity (more entity types) with simplicity (fewer entity types)
- Consider hierarchical entity types for complex domains
- Use composite entities for related information

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- Entity types should be clearly distinguishable
- Each entity should serve a specific purpose in the conversation flow
- Entity types should be consistent with business vocabulary

### Handling Rare Entities

**Best Practice**: Ensure reliable recognition of infrequent entities.

**Implementation**:

- Add more training examples for rare entities
- Use data augmentation to create variations
- Consider regex or gazetteer approaches for highly structured entities
- Implement post-processing rules for critical rare entities

**Dashboard Approach**:

- Sort entities by support count to identify rare entities
- Check F1 score on entities with low support
- Add examples if both support and F1 score are low

### Entity Extraction Across Intents

**Best Practice**: Ensure consistent entity extraction regardless of intent.

**Implementation**:

- Add examples of each entity across multiple relevant intents
- Check entity performance across different intents using the dashboard
- Standardize entity annotation patterns across intents

**Example**:
Ensure the "date" entity is properly extracted in:

- book_flight intent: "I want to fly on January 15th"
- check_weather intent: "What's the weather for January 15th"
- schedule_meeting intent: "Set up a meeting for January 15th"

## Model Training and Tuning

### Model Selection

**Best Practice**: Choose the appropriate model architecture for your requirements.

**Implementation**:

- Consider these factors:
  - Dataset size (smaller datasets â†’ simpler models)
  - Performance requirements (accuracy vs. speed)
  - Available computational resources
  - Specific strengths (intent classification vs. entity extraction)

**Common Options**:

- BERT-based models: High accuracy, higher resource requirements
- DIET: Good balance of performance and resource usage
- Transformer-based: Strong for complex language understanding
- Rule-based: Useful for highly structured inputs

### Hyperparameter Optimization

**Best Practice**: Systematically tune model hyperparameters.

**Implementation**:

- Start with recommended defaults
- Use grid search or random search for exploration
- Focus on these key parameters:
  - Learning rate
  - Batch size
  - Number of epochs
  - Architecture-specific parameters (layers, dropout, etc.)

**Dashboard-Driven Approach**:

- Track performance across versions with different parameters
- Use the Model Comparison feature to identify effective changes
- Balance overall metrics with performance on challenging cases

### Training Regime

**Best Practice**: Implement a robust training approach.

**Implementation**:

- Use cross-validation to prevent overfitting
- Implement early stopping based on validation performance
- Try different train/test splits to ensure robustness
- For critical applications, use ensemble models

**Warning Signs**:

- Large gap between training and testing performance
- Inconsistent performance across different data splits
- Major performance regression after small data changes

## Evaluation and Testing

### Comprehensive Evaluation

**Best Practice**: Evaluate across multiple dimensions.

**Implementation**:

- Use the dashboard to evaluate:
  - Overall intent and entity metrics
  - Per-intent and per-entity performance
  - Performance on high-priority intents
  - Common confusion patterns
  - Confidence distribution

**Balanced Approach**:

- Don't optimize for a single metric
- Consider the business impact of different error types
- Prioritize improvements based on user impact

### Regression Testing

**Best Practice**: Prevent performance regression on existing capabilities.

**Implementation**:

- Maintain a "golden set" of critical test cases
- Set up automated regression testing
- Compare new model versions against benchmarks
- Use the dashboard's version comparison feature

**Regression Testing Process**:

1. Define key examples that must work correctly
2. Test each new model version against these examples
3. Investigate any regressions before deployment

### Real-World Testing

**Best Practice**: Test with realistic user inputs before deployment.

**Implementation**:

- Conduct user testing with actual users
- Implement "shadow mode" testing (process real inputs without responding)
- Compare distribution of real inputs vs. training data
- Continuously update test cases based on actual usage

**Dashboard Application**:

- Upload shadow mode logs for analysis
- Identify gaps between expected and actual queries
- Use Error Explorer to find patterns in misclassified real inputs

## Deployment and Monitoring
