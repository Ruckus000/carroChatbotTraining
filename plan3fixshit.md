Okay, here is a detailed, multi-phase plan designed for Cursor to finalize the simplified NLU system (Path A). This plan incorporates the findings from the previous review and provides explicit instructions to minimize errors.

**Overarching Goal:** Achieve a clean, working NLU system based _only_ on `data/nlu_training_data.json`, `train.py`, and `inference.py` (containing only `NLUInferencer`), removing all conflicting code and artifacts.

**General Instructions for Cursor:**

- **Follow Phases Sequentially:** Complete all steps within a phase, including passing the specified test, before moving to the next.
- **Adhere Strictly to Instructions:** Execute _only_ the steps described. Do not add features, optimizations, or code from other parts of the repository (like `langgraph_integration`, `context_integration`, old training scripts, etc.). The goal is simplification and cleanup.
- **Do Not Modify Provided Test Scripts:** Execute the specified test script (`test_phaseX.py` or the root `test_integration.py`) at the end of each phase. If a test fails, modify the code you generated _in that phase_ (e.g., `train.py` in Phase 1, `inference.py` in Phase 2) to fix the issue based on the test output and these instructions. **DO NOT CHANGE THE TEST SCRIPT ITSELF.**
- **File Locations:** Assume all commands are run from the project's root directory. Refer to files using their full paths from the root (e.g., `data/nlu_training_data.json`, `inference.py`).
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic `try...except` blocks for file operations and model loading as specified. If you encounter an error you cannot resolve, stop and report it clearly.
- **CPU Focus:** Ensure all training and inference uses the CPU. The `TrainingArguments` in `train.py` should already include `no_cuda=True`.

**Phase 1: Verify and Fix Training Execution**

**Goal:** Ensure `train.py` successfully runs using `data/nlu_training_data.json`, correctly prepares data (including BIO tags), trains the two simplified models (Intent & Entity), and saves the model artifacts to the `./trained_nlu_model/` directory.

**Steps:**

1.  **Locate `train.py`:** Confirm the `train.py` script exists in the root directory.
2.  **Review/Fix `train.py`:**
    - **Training Data Path:** Verify that `load_data` function inside `train.py` loads data specifically from `'data/nlu_training_data.json'`.
    - **Training Arguments:** Find the `TrainingArguments` instances (one for intent, one for entity).
      - Ensure the `output_dir` points to a temporary checkpoint directory (e.g., `./trained_nlu_model/intent_model_checkpoints` and `./trained_nlu_model/entity_model_checkpoints`).
      - Verify `no_cuda=True` is present in both `TrainingArguments` instances.
      - **Crucially:** Find the `evaluation_strategy` argument. If it exists, **change it** to `eval_strategy`. If `eval_strategy` already exists, ensure it's set to `"epoch"`. Do the same for `save_strategy`. (This addresses the error noted in `plan3fixshit.md`).
    - **Entity Data Preparation:** Locate the `prepare_entity_dataset` function (or similar logic).
      - Verify it calls the `convert_text_entities_to_bio` helper function.
      - Ensure the tokenization within `prepare_entity_dataset` uses `is_split_into_words=False` after getting the BIO tags for the _original_ words.
      - Ensure the label alignment logic correctly assigns tag IDs from `tag2id` and uses `-100` for special tokens and subsequent subword tokens. Add error handling (e.g., `try...except` block within the loop) to print problematic examples and skip them if `convert_text_entities_to_bio` or tag mapping fails for a specific example, preventing the whole process from crashing.
    - **Unseen Labels:** Locate where `val_intent_ids` are created. Ensure the handling for intents present in `val_data` but not `train_data` maps them to a defined fallback ID (e.g., `fallback_low_confidence` or `fallback_out_of_scope` if they exist in `intent2id`, otherwise default to ID 0) and prints a clear warning, rather than potentially crashing.
    - **Model Saving:** Verify the _final_ saving step uses `.save_pretrained()` to save the trained `intent_model` and `intent_tokenizer` to `./trained_nlu_model/intent_model/` and the `entity_model` and `entity_tokenizer` to `./trained_nlu_model/entity_model/`. Also confirm it saves `intent2id.json` and `tag2id.json` to their respective directories.
3.  **Delete Previous Model Output (if exists):** Manually or programmatically remove the _entire_ `./trained_nlu_model/` directory if it exists to ensure a clean training run. `shutil.rmtree('./trained_nlu_model', ignore_errors=True)` can be used in Python.
4.  **Execute Training:** Run the script from the root directory: `python train.py`. Monitor the console output for errors. Pay attention to warnings about unseen labels or errors during entity preparation.
5.  **Verify Output Directory:** After the script finishes, check that the `./trained_nlu_model/` directory exists and contains the `intent_model/` and `entity_model/` subdirectories, populated with model files (`pytorch_model.bin` or `model.safetensors`, `config.json`), tokenizer files (`tokenizer_config.json`, `vocab.txt`), and the ID mapping files (`intent2id.json`, `tag2id.json`).

**Phase 1 Test:**

- **Instruction:** Run `python test_phase2.py` (Note: We run `test_phase2.py` here because it checks the _output_ of the training process described in this phase). **DO NOT MODIFY THE TEST SCRIPT.**
- **Debugging:** If the test fails:
  - Check the console output from `python train.py` for errors.
  - Verify the `./trained_nlu_model/` directory structure and file contents based on step 5 above.
  - Review and fix the relevant parts of `train.py` (data loading, BIO tagging, training arguments, model saving paths).
  - Repeat steps 3, 4, and 5 until `test_phase2.py` passes.

**Phase 2: Clean and Verify Inference Script**

**Goal:** Ensure `inference.py` contains _only_ the `NLUInferencer` class and that it correctly loads and uses the models produced in Phase 1.

**Steps:**

1.  **Locate `inference.py`:** Confirm the `inference.py` script exists in the root directory.
2.  **Edit `inference.py`:**
    - **Delete Old Classes:** Remove the entire class definition for `CarroAssistant` and `ContextAwareCarroAssistant`.
    - **Remove Unused Imports:** Delete any imports that were only used by the removed classes (e.g., potentially specific context handling utilities if they were imported). Keep imports for `os`, `json`, `torch`, `numpy`, `transformers` (specific classes), and potentially `re`/`difflib` if used in BIO grouping.
    - **Verify `NLUInferencer.__init__`:**
      - Confirm it loads models using `DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(self.intent_model_path)` and `DistilBertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(self.entity_model_path)`.
      - Confirm it loads tokenizers using `DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(...)`.
      - Confirm it loads `intent2id.json` and `tag2id.json` correctly.
      - Confirm it sets `self.device = torch.device("cpu")` and moves models `.to(self.device)`.
    - **Verify `NLUInferencer._predict_intent`:**
      - Confirm it uses `self.intent_tokenizer` and `self.intent_model`.
      - Confirm it applies the `self.CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` correctly to assign `fallback_low_confidence`.
    - **Verify `NLUInferencer._predict_entities`:**
      - Confirm it uses `self.entity_tokenizer` and `self.entity_model`.
      - **Carefully review the BIO tag grouping logic:** Ensure it correctly iterates through the aligned `(word, predicted_tag)` pairs and groups `B-` followed by corresponding `I-` tags into single entities. Check edge cases (entity at start/end, consecutive entities, misaligned `I-` tags).
    - **Verify `NLUInferencer.predict`:**
      - Confirm it calls `_predict_intent` and `_predict_entities`.
      - Confirm it returns the dictionary in the specified format: `{"text": ..., "intent": {"name": ..., "confidence": ...}, "entities": [...]}`.
      - Ensure basic error handling (`try...except`) wraps the core prediction logic.

**Phase 2 Test:**

- **Instruction:** Run `python test_phase3.py`. **DO NOT MODIFY THE TEST SCRIPT.**
- **Debugging:** If the test fails:
  - Check for any `NameError` or `AttributeError` in `inference.py` resulting from the cleanup.
  - Verify the model loading paths and file names in `NLUInferencer.__init__`.
  - Ensure the `predict` method returns a dictionary with the exact keys and value types expected by the test (`text`, `intent` (dict with `name`, `confidence`), `entities` (list of dicts with `entity`, `value`)).
  - Review and fix the code in `inference.py`. Repeat until `test_phase3.py` passes.

**Phase 3: Run Integration Test with Real Models**

**Goal:** Verify that the complete, simplified NLU pipeline (`inference.py` using models from `train.py`) produces plausible outputs for sample inputs.

**Steps:**

1.  **Locate `test_integration.py`:** Confirm the **root-level** `test_integration.py` script exists.
2.  **Edit `test_integration.py`:**
    - Find the mocking code section near the beginning (it might start with `# Mock the existence of model files...` or use `patch(...)`).
    - **Carefully delete or comment out** all the mocking code related to creating dummy files and patching the `transformers` library (`patch(...)` lines). The test must now use the _actual_ `NLUInferencer` which loads the _real_ models from `./trained_nlu_model/`.
3.  **Execute Integration Test:** Run `python test_integration.py`.
4.  **Analyze Output:** Review the output. It will print the input text and the prediction (`intent` and `entities`). The test checks if the predicted intent _type_ matches the expectation (e.g., a towing request results in an intent starting with `towing_`) and if expected _types_ of entities are present.

**Phase 3 Test:**

- **Instruction:** The execution of `python test_integration.py` _is_ the test.
- **Debugging:** If the test fails (`[FAIL]` messages appear):
  - **Focus on `inference.py` first:** The most likely cause is incorrect entity extraction/grouping logic in `_predict_entities`. Add print statements inside the BIO grouping loop to understand how it's processing tags and words. Also double-check the subword alignment logic.
  - **Check Confidence:** Is the `fallback_low_confidence` triggering unexpectedly? Temporarily print the confidence score in `inference.py` or lower the threshold in `NLUInferencer` for debugging.
  - **Check Model Quality (Last Resort):** If inference seems correct, the models trained in Phase 1 might be performing very poorly. You could try slightly increasing epochs (e.g., to 3) in `train.py` and rerunning Phase 1, then re-test here. However, prioritize fixing inference logic first.
  - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until `test_integration.py` reports `All tests PASSED!`.

---

**Phase 4: Project Cleanup and Documentation**

**Goal:** Remove all obsolete code, data, and documentation related to the old complex system and the abandoned LangGraph/Mistral approach, leaving only the simplified NLU components. Update `requirements.txt` and `README.md`.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create Cleanup Script (Optional but Recommended):** Create a _new_ script `cleanup.py` (or reuse/verify the existing one if it precisely matches the targets below). This script should perform the deletions and updates programmatically. **Review the script carefully before running.**
    - **Files to Delete:** List _explicitly_ the files to be deleted (use the list from the previous "Refined Plan - Phase 5"). Include paths like `chatbot_training.py`, `model_training.py`, `evaluation.py`, `streamlit_app.py`, all files in `data/` **except** `nlu_training_data.json`, all files in `tests/` **except** `__init__.py`, `test_integration.py`, `test_phase*.py`, etc.
    - **Directories to Delete:** List _explicitly_ the directories to be deleted (`langgraph_integration/`, `data/context_integration/`, potentially `output/` if it contains old checkpoints). Use `shutil.rmtree(..., ignore_errors=True)`.
    - **Update Requirements:** The script should overwrite `requirements.txt` with _only_ the necessary packages: `transformers`, `torch`, `datasets`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `seqeval`. Pin versions if desired (e.g., `transformers>=4.30.0`).
    - **Update README:** The script should overwrite `README.md` with the simple content described previously (overview, setup, data, training, inference, testing for the _simplified_ system).
2.  **Execute Cleanup:** Run `python cleanup.py` OR perform the deletions and updates manually, being extremely careful.
3.  **Verify File Structure:** Manually check the project directory to ensure only the expected files (`README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `train.py`, `inference.py`, `test_integration.py`, `data/nlu_training_data.json`, `trained_nlu_model/`, `.gitignore`, `tests/`, etc.) remain.

**Phase 4 Test:**

- **Instruction:** Run `python test_phase5.py` (Note: This test verifies the cleanup). **DO NOT MODIFY THE TEST SCRIPT.**
- **Debugging:** If the test fails:
  - Check the error messages. Did it find files that should have been deleted? Are required files missing?
  - Manually delete any remaining obsolete files/folders listed in the plan.
  - Ensure `requirements.txt` and `README.md` were correctly updated/created.
  - Repeat step 2 and 3 until `test_phase5.py` passes.

---

**Final Outcome:**

After successfully completing these four phases, the repository will contain a clean, simplified NLU system. You will have:

- Consolidated training data (`data/nlu_training_data.json`).
- A working training script (`train.py`).
- Trained NLU models (`./trained_nlu_model/`).
- A focused inference script (`inference.py` with `NLUInferencer`).
- A passing integration test (`test_integration.py`).
- Correct dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
- Accurate documentation (`README.md`).

At this point, you are **ready** to start building the dialog management and response generation logic, using the output from `NLUInferencer` as the input to that next layer.
