# Plan to Fix Remaining Issues in the Context Integration Branch

After reviewing the current state of the feature/context-integration branch, the following issues still need to be addressed:

## Training Issues

1. In `train.py`:
   - Incompatible TrainingArguments parameter: `evaluation_strategy` is not recognized
   - Entity example preparation errors:
     - Error preparing entity example 1: 'B-truck_type'
     - Error preparing entity example 4: 'list' object has no attribute 'split'
   - Multiple "Unseen intent" warnings in validation set that should be better handled

## Entity Recognition Issues

- The entity parsing contains several potential edge cases that need to be addressed:
  - BIO tag alignment may have edge cases with subword tokenization
  - The current implementation might not handle words split across multiple tokens optimally

## Integration Testing Issues

- While the integration tests pass, they do so by directly replacing the prediction methods with mock implementations:
  ```python
  inferencer._predict_intent = custom_predict_intent
  inferencer._predict_entities = custom_predict_entities
  ```
- This masks potential issues in the actual implementation that would occur with real models

## Context Handling

- The context tracking implementation has mostly placeholder code
- The full context-aware implementation needs more complete development instead of just placeholders

## Next Steps

The feature branch appears to be functional for basic NLU tasks but requires fixes to the training script and more development of context handling features according to the context integration plan.
