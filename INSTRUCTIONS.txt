Easy Setup Instructions
============================

1. Start API server with: export PORT=8001 && python api.py
   (or use ./start_api.sh if available)
2. Your React Native app should connect to this server at http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8001
3. Use the /api/dialog endpoint with a JSON payload like: {"text": "Your message", "conversation_id": "optional_id"}
4. For NLU-only analysis (including sentiment), use /api/nlu endpoint
5. Set the 'X-Platform: React Native' header in your requests
6. All chat messages appear in the server terminal with ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µ highlighting
7. The system now includes sentiment analysis and will adapt responses for urgent situations
============================

Example curl commands:

# Dialog endpoint (maintains conversation state):
curl -H "X-Platform: React Native" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://localhost:8001/api/dialog -d '{"text": "I need a tow, my car broke down"}'

# NLU endpoint (with sentiment analysis):
curl -H "X-Platform: React Native" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://localhost:8001/api/nlu -d '{"text": "I am frustrated, my car broke down"}'
