# Context Integration Feature

## Overview

This feature enhances the chatbot's ability to handle negation (e.g., "I don't need a tow truck") and context switching (e.g., "Actually, forget the tow truck; I need a new battery"). The implementation uses multi-task learning and context-aware processing to improve the user experience.

## Key Components

1. **Enhanced Data Collection and Augmentation**

   - Specialized negation examples
   - Context switching variations
   - Data augmentation for better coverage

2. **Improved Model Architecture**

   - Contextual Intent Classifier
   - Multi-task Clarification Detection (negation, context switching, clarification)
   - Context-aware entity extraction

3. **Context-Aware Inference Process**

   - Conversation history tracking
   - Detection of negation and context switches
   - Clarification mechanism

4. **Specialized Testing**
   - Negation-specific test cases
   - Context switching metrics
   - Multi-turn conversation evaluation

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Day 1**: Data preparation and augmentation
2. **Day 2-3**: Model architecture updates
3. **Day 4**: Inference engine updates
4. **Day 5**: Testing and evaluation

## Success Metrics

- Negation Detection Accuracy
- Context Switch Detection Accuracy
- Entity Extraction with Context
- Multi-turn Success Rate
- Overall User Satisfaction

## Development Branch

All development work for this feature takes place in the `feature/context-integration` branch.
